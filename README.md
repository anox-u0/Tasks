# 📅 Tasks: A Reverse To-Do List for Breaking Bad Habits

**Tasks** is a minimalist web application that flips the traditional to-do list on its head. Instead of tracking tasks you *complete*, it helps you monitor habits you *avoid*. With a black-and-white aesthetic and a distraction-free interface, Tasks supports your journey toward better habits by keeping things simple and focused.
